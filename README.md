db-tester
=========

It's a PHP program that can run tests into MySQL databases. I might update it to run PHP tests too.


Why?
====

I needed develop it because, when I moved from MySQL to MariaDB, I needed test how much diferrence it had.

Installing
==========

Right now, it can't. But I've planned to put it in your php host, specify the DB and run the URL.
